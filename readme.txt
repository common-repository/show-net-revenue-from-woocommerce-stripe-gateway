Shows the Stripe fee and net revenue for Woocommerce order listings in the admin area.

== Description ==
The WooCommerce Stripe Gateway adds extra information to each order about the fee taken and the remaining net revenue. Before v4.0.0 this information is not visible anywhere. After v4.0.0 this is only visible for new orders in the Order page.

This plugin adds two columns to the WooCommerce Order list and below the Order totals on the Order page (on legacy orders). Visible by shop admins only.
